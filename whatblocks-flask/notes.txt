configuration
    	Create your application in a function and register blueprints on it. That way you can create multiple instances of your application with different configurations attached which makes unit testing a lot easier. You can use this to pass in configuration as needed.

    Do not write code that needs the configuration at import time. If you limit yourself to request-only accesses to the configuration you can reconfigure the object later on as needed.
